# GraphQL Server with Elastic Search Integration - Readme

Welcome to the GraphQL server project with Elastic Search integration! This project demonstrates the integration of a GraphQL server using Apollo Server with Elastic Search. It allows performing CRUD operations on data stored in Elastic Search. The project is built using TypeScript and includes unit tests using Jest.



## Project Overview
The GraphQL server project integrates a GraphQL API with Elastic Search, providing a flexible and efficient way to query and manipulate data. It leverages Apollo Server for handling GraphQL requests and Elastic Search for data storage and retrieval. The project includes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage data stored in Elastic Search.
